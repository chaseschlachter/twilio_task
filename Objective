I need Twilio to message every phone number in a given event from my model 20 minutes after the event starts.
The event start time is listed as the `event_start` variable in the event model.

I've included the `showEvent` function of my events controller for additional context and in case that function
needs to call the Twilio function (wherever that may end up) on a delay. Basically, without fully knowing
how this will work I'm anticipating the code will be written in the events controller (as that's where 
most of the functionality for my app resides).

It's critical that the code send the text on time (20 mins after event_start) *even if* guests
add their number a week or even a month in advance.

I've also added some dummy data to the repo to help you build the feature.

I'm happy to add more code it you need!
